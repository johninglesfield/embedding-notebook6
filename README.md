# embedding-notebook6
The notebook in this repository contains examples of the embedding method for photonics, illustrating chapter 9 of my book "The Embedding Method for Electronic Structure", published by Institute of Physics Publishing (available as a printed book or ebook). As well as programs for calculating modes in a dielectric waveguide, it contains programs for calculating the spectral density of a square lattice of metallic cylinders, for comparison with the plasmonic band structure.
