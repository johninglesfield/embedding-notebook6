# embedding-notebook6
The notebook in this repository contains examples of the embedding method for photonics, illustrating chapter 9 of my book "The Embedding Method for Electronic Structure". As well as programs for calculating modes in a dielectric waveguide, it contains programs for calculating the plasmonic band structure of a square lattice of metallic cylinders.
